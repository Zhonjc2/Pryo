It contains Client and Server, and use request and response model.  
It support every platform that support JavaFX.  
It's interface completely based on JavaFX, and no third-party controls.  
It is a litle practice of Computer Networks.  
There is a server built by me, and you can use PryoNote without build Server.  
My server is usually running, but sometimes it will closed by some unkonwn error. I will check it promptly.
